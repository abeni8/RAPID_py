Hi Zida,

The river data is available in the 3D-CHESS shared google drive folder.
3D-CHESS -> Scenarios -> Scenario3

This folder (TX_width) providers the raw data as given by George:

A csv file (river_info.csv) with the stream widths per day of the year is here:

I made a python script (process_river_data.py)  to process the raw river data from George. The raw data contains some more parameters about the streams than just the widths. For example, I believe each stream is not identified by just the first and last vertices, but it can contain several intermediate vertices (and hence made up of sequence of line segments). 
You may modify the script to access these other parameters as well.

There are two other folders called TX_CDF and TX_uncertainity, which contain wet/dry uncertainty estimates. George produced the dataset.

I have also attached a couple of pdfs of emails which are relevant to the dataset.
Please let me know if there are any questions.

Best,
Vinay
